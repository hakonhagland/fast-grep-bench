### How to create the missing files?

I was not able to include the file `file2.txt` in the repository due
to its large file size. Hence, you will have to create the files.

First create a file `words.txt` or copy one from the `cases` folder.
Then run the script `gen_input_files.pl`. You can specify options in
the source file itself, like the number of lines to create in each
file.
